Description:

        cplay is a curses front-end for various audio players. It aims
        to provide a power-user-friendly interface with simple filelist
        and playlist control. cplay is written in Python and can use
        either pyncurses or the standard curses module.

Installation:

        make install

Usage:

        cplay [-nrRv] [ file | dir | playlist ] ...

        When in doubt, press 'h' for a friendly help page.

Configuration:

        If you would like to change options passed to the actual players
        just edit the PLAYERS list in the cplay script or put the PLAYERS
        definition in either ~/.cplayrc or /etc/cplayrc. If one of these
        files is available, it is executed by cplay before initialization.

        Note, currently there is no version control for the rc-file!

Miscellaneous:

        In order for either mp3info (ID3) or ogginfo to work,
        both corresponding python modules have to be installed.
        This will probably change someday.

        A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will
        have to be local. For mpeg streaming, splay is recommended.

        It is also possible to pipe a playlist to cplay, as stdin
        will be reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.

        Remote control via /tmp/cplay-control-$USER; see lircrc.
