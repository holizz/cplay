.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cplay
is a front-end for various audio players. It aims to provide a
user-friendly interface with simple filelist and playlist
control.  Invoking
.B cplay
without any options puts you in the filelist in which you
can navigate around looking for audio files.  When you
specify an audio file,
.B cplay
automatically adds it to the playlist which can be accessed
by pressing the tabulator key.

Use 'h' to display the help window.

Shell command-lines are executed with tagged or current entries
as positional parameters, which means that "$@" might be useful.
